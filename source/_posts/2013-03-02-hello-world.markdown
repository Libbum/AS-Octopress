In the past, my blogs have always been akin to a public, online diary. They tended to generally be inane drivel about what we got up to on Friday night. With that being said, the era I'm referring to is circa 2002; modern technology has moved on - now we have Facebook for that kind of shit. 

My goals for this blog are somewhat different. I've realised that my grandiose schemes for this domain ([neophilus.net](http://www.neophilus.net)) are most likely never going to happen, and my life now is considerably busier than it was back in the day. Also, no-one gives two shits about some random guys' everyday life; not unless they're a 13 yo girl swooning over a pop star. 

If you are a 13 yo girl; fan-mail is appreciated, although I highly doubt you're my target audience. 

I'm a physicist, interested in high performance computing, Linux, electronics, UAVs, hardware & software hacking, optimisation and science in general (I elaborate a little more on my [about](/about.html) page). My blog will mostly be about these topics (there will likely be a few posts on ancient history or linguistics from time to time as well). 

Initially, I intend [Axiomatic Semantics](http://axiomatic.neophilus.net) to be a log of things I'm learning as I push through this barrier I seem to be approaching presently: a capable programmer that isn't really working on public projects at all, but feels he should be. Also, there's a massive amount of information I'm discovering as I complete my PhD, or my research work at DSTO - a lot of it I feel may be useful to others out there. There's also the added bonus of this ultimately being an easy archive for me to come back to in the future - once I've totally forgot about something and attempt to reinvent the wheel.

Bare with me for a bit whilst I get the back end set up to my liking - actual content will soon follow.

This is just a dumping ground for site testing - it'll be removed once everything is set up to my liking.
