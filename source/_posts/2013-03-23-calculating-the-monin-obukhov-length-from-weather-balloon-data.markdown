When studying turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer, a number of processes (friction, heat fluxes, wind shear) can affect the dynamics of the system. Temperature gradients can also either generate or suppress turbulence, and the height of the layer can change depending on a number of stratification effects. 
Monoin etc
