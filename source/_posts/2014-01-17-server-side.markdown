Things are happening, I have not forgotten about this place at all; have just [been busy](http://cqplabs.neophilus.net). I'm still not too happy about the theme I've built here; so I plan to get on to toning a few things down a little soon (lager font, removing a lot of images I thought would be nice but will ultimately flood the layout with eye jamming, flow stopping annoyances. Also, I'm moving all of my sites off of [Just Host](http://www.justhost.com) shared space to an unmanaged VPS on [Iperweb](www.iperweb.com) – which means a massive amount of back end work is going on at present.

Content, updates, all of those good things will need to wait just a little longer…
